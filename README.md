# **[UWP] Hydrox Script Hub**
Basically a script hub for roblox with game support and universal loaders. If you encounter bugs please contact me through my discord: 7ivq

## **How do i use them?**
You **require** a roblox executor. If you do not know what a executor is then you probably shouldnt be at this github, if you know what a executor is you can proceed. If you want the best Hydrox experience then i would recommend you use **[UWP]** Fluxus or **[UWP]** Electron.
Hydrox is not officially supported for mobile devices and executors as mobile executors are pretty shit.

- Download any executor (Fluxus UWP or Electron recommended.)
- Go into a game and inject your executor.
- Execute hydrox from the github.

Thats about it, you can now use **Hydrox**

## **Any Issues?**
If you have any issues, join our discord server. I can support you from there.
